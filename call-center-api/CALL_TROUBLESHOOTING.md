# Call Integration Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Call Immediately Ends (Missed Call Issue)

**Problem**: Calls are initiated successfully but end immediately, showing as missed calls.

**Root Cause**: Africa's Talking cannot reach your webhook URL during development because:
- Your webhook URL is set to `https://ncc.newarkfrontierstech.co.ke/api/call`
- This URL is not accessible during local development
- Without webhook callbacks, AT doesn't know how to handle the call flow

**Solutions**:

#### Option A: Use ngrok for local development
```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Expose your local server
ngrok http 8000

# Update your AT webhook URL to: https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/call
```

#### Option B: Use mock progression (current implementation)
- The system now includes mock call progression for development
- Calls will simulate: queued → ringing → in-progress → completed
- This allows UI testing without webhook dependencies

### 2. Frontend UI Not Updating

**Problem**: Call modal shows "Calling..." indefinitely.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed WebSocket connection URL
- ✅ Added proper error handling and connection management
- ✅ Improved call state transitions
- ✅ Added automatic cleanup after call ends

### 3. API Endpoint Mismatch

**Problem**: Frontend was calling wrong endpoint.

**Fix**: Updated frontend to call correct endpoint `/api/calls/initiate`

## Current Call Flow

1. **Call Initiation**: 
   - Frontend calls `/api/calls/initiate`
   - Backend calls Africa's Talking API
   - Call record created in database
   - WebSocket connection established

2. **Call Progression** (Development Mode):
   - Mock progression simulates real call states
   - WebSocket sends updates to frontend
   - Database updated with call status

3. **Call Completion**:
   - Final status sent via WebSocket
   - Frontend UI resets after 3 seconds
   - Call record finalized in database

## Testing the Integration

Run the test script to verify AT integration:
```bash
cd /home/izaack/Pictures/call-centre-ATA/call-center-api
python3 test_at_integration.py
```

## Production Deployment

For production, ensure:
1. Webhook URL is publicly accessible
2. Set `DEBUG=false` in environment
3. Configure proper SSL certificates
4. Monitor webhook delivery in AT dashboard

## Environment Variables

Key variables for call integration:
```env
AT_API_KEY=your_api_key
AT_USERNAME=your_username
AT_SANDBOX=false
AT_PHONE_NUMBERS=+254111052357,+254709155527,...
DEBUG=true  # Enables mock progression
```

## Monitoring Call Issues

Check logs for:
- AT API responses
- WebSocket connection status
- Database call records
- Webhook delivery (in production)
